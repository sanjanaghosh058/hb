              <p>I want you to know this. I didn't make this webpage just for your birthday. I made it because sometimes words alone aren't enough to show what someone means to you.</p>
              <p>Every picture here… every memory…every small moment of your life…feels like a story I always wanted to understand more deeply.</p>
              <p>You might think these are just photos. But for me, they are pieces of a girl I admire in ways I never managed to say out loud: her strength, her softness, her stubbornness, her innocence, her fire, her quiet beauty.</p>

              <p>You know… I never understood how two people could drift apart and still feel connected, until us.</p>
              <p>Because even in the quiet spaces, even in the distance, you stayed with me in a way I can't explain.</p>
              <p>And it reminds me of Monica and Chandler. They weren't some big dramatic love story. They didn't fall in love in one grand moment it happened slowly, softly, in the small ways they showed up for each other.</p>
              <p>A friendship that turned into a feeling… a feeling that refused to disappear… and a bond that became home without either of them even realising it.</p>
              <p class="emphasis">And that's exactly what you became for me.</p>
              <p>With you, everything felt familiar like I didn't have to pretend, didn't have to impress, didn't have to hide the messy parts of me.</p>
              <p>I don't know how to express this except to say:</p>
              <p class="love-declaration">I'm in love with you.</p>
              <p>Not in the dramatic way… but in the steady, "you're my safe place" way.</p>
              <p class="emphasis">And if life ever gives us even the smallest chance I want to show you a love that's patient, warm, soft, steady… the kind of love that grows quietly but stays forever.</p>
